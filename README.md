# Python Tutorials

Oh, hey there!
Welcome to the git repository for MESA Python tutorials! 
Initially intended for MESA coding workshops, but its a great source to start learning python (even if you don't know any code prior)

The materials is based off of CSE20, the first CS course you will take in college (UCSC)
All notebooks/ slides are made by me and this is a quick table of contents:

- L1: Introduction
- L2: Variables and Conditional Statements
- L3: For Loops, Functions, and Strings
- L4: [Data Structures] Lists, Dictionaries, and Tuples
- L5: Classes, Inheritance, File Handling
- L6: Importing Modules and Demonstrating Libraries
